	This is an example of how to configure a basic Unicorn configuration to include a set of security roles to sync.

	See Unicorn.config for commentary on how configurations operate, or https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn/blob/master/README.md

					<rolePredicate type="Unicorn.Roles.RolePredicates.ConfigurationRolePredicate, Unicorn.Roles" singleInstance="true">
						<!--
							Each include must either include a domain, which includes all roles under that domain,
							or a domain with a role regex pattern to determine specific roles to include under the domain.
							
							For regex pattern rules, note that the regex applies to the role not including the domain,
							e.g. for "sitecore\foo" the regex pattern is checked against "foo" if the domain is set to "sitecore"
