* Verify that core DP read fields behavior is compatible with SFS DS - e.g. item's fields only no std vals - and what about modified etc when from SFS only items
* Check behaviour of items that are SFS only with DP
* Need to check DP read behavior with syncing - esp around that whole orange color thing, but otherwise as well
* Need to srsly optimize the perf of the tree with DP read enabled. Ideas:
	- Cache paths into a dictionary in the predicate (since DP calls make a lot of predication, if we cache the result maybe minor help)
	- Need to trace through what SFS is doing. I suspect there's a lot of duplication there even with the pathcache. 
		Consider a single preload of the meta cache at startup/first hit? Easy to test.
* Orange color thing is not working correctly
