TODO:
- Evaluator does not really control all aspects of evaluation. Really, since it already controls deletion, it should also control update/delete at the provider level as opposed to the loader doing it based on evaluator results.
- Write integration tests for Sitecore-based providers
- Out of box experience to do initial serialization and guide the user. Probably a httprequestbegin pipeline processor. Fire only when debug=true, provide built-in serialize all, show config/providers in use? - maybe graphical sitecore tree with red/green?, and sync capabilities
- Verify operation with non standard serialization root
- Preview mode?
