TODO:
- SQL provider tests
- Need to figure out a good solution for handling moving children of renames and moves in a sensible fashion that evaluates the inclusion of all children properly
- Implement custom deserializer that can handle missing fields with a warning and report on individual updated field values
- Write integration tests for Sitecore-based providers
- Redo conflict processor to use serialization provider
- Is there a way we can effectively parallelize the loader?
- Test retrying failed deserializations - esp inline loading of new template fields along with the template item
- Test moving and copying and renaming in cross-inclusion territory
- Automagical serialization of default preset items if the root serialization path is totally empty
- Async serialization file writes with a read/write lock system? + perf testing
- Some sort of short-span dupe detection in the data provider? Sitecore is pretty save-happy and that can result in 2-3 serializations per 'save'
