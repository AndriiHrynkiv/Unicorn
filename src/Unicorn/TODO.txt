- Consider defaulting the data store path to auto unique per configuration?
- Do something with the remoting project
- Tests?
- 8.0U5: publishing to a database with a configuration that has transparent sync enabled appears to hose the database by somehow corrupting the templates
	- Data seems corrupt in the db, turning off transparent does not fix things
	- Templates were not included in the transparent configuration
	- Appears to occur as long as UDP is attached to the web database, and anything at all has transparent on. If transparent always off, no issue.
