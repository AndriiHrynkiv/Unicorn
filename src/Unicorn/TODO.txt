TODO:
- Implement custom deserializer that can handle missing fields with a warning and report on individual updated field values
- Write integration tests for Sitecore-based providers
- Out of box experience to do initial serialization and guide the user. Probably a httprequestbegin pipeline processor. Fire only when debug=true, provide built-in serialize all, show config/providers in use? - maybe graphical sitecore tree with red/green?, and sync capabilities
- Verify operation with non standard serialization root
