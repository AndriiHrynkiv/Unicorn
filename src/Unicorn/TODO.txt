Bug list:
1. Seems that its not detecting modified timestamp changes correctly. The Evaluator does not appear to be being invoked at all, which makes me wonder if the SL's abilities to load the corresponding item are busted.
2. Presets' serializeall method is not implemented. We should modify to take a progress. Maybe this method should go somewhere else too - starting paths and presets/predicates don't really seem to be the same concern necessarily?
3. Integrate the conflict processor into less one-off APIs
4. Integrate the FilteredItemHandler into less one-off APIs
5. Change the filtered item handler into a wrapped data provider
6. Tests. Lots of em.
