TODO:
- Need to figure out a good solution for handling moving children of renames and moves in a sensible fashion that evaluates the inclusion of all children properly
- Implement custom deserializer that can handle missing fields with a warning and report on individual updated field values
- Write integration tests for Sitecore-based providers
- Test moving and copying and renaming in cross-inclusion territory
- Automagical serialization of default preset items if the root serialization path is totally empty
- Async serialization file writes with a read/write lock system? + perf testing
