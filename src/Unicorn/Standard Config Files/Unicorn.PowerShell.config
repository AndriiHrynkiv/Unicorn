<!--
	Unicorn.PowerShell.config

	Activates Sitecore PowerShell Extensions (SPE) cmdlets for Unicorn operations.
	
	The following cmdlets are currently supported:
	Get-UnicornConfiguration
	Sync-UnicornConfiguration
	Export-UnicornConfiguration
	Out-Yaml
	Import-Yaml
	
	Use 'Get-Help [cmdname]' at a SPE console to see the arguments for each command.
	
	NOTE: This file may remain active without SPE installed and it won't break anything.
	
	This file should be active on any environment where you wish to execute Unicorn SPE commands. Usually, that'd be dev and CE only. If you're not using SPE you can disable or remove this file.
