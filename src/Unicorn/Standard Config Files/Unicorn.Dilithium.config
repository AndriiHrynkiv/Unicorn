	Unicorn.Dilithium.config

	This file activates the Dilithium high-speed Sitecore data access provider.
	Dilithium is up to 20x faster than standard Sitecore data access APIs.
	
	This file should be enabled on any environment where you wish to sync items
	using Dilithium (usually dev + CE). Should you wish to say disable Dilithium on CE,
	but leave it alone locally then you can simply delete this file during deploy.
	(configurations will have no issue if they keep using the DilithiumDataStore, as it falls back to Sitecore APIs)
	
	THINGS TO BE AWARE OF WITH DILITHIUM:
	* Dilithium will precache all serialized data in RAM; if precaching both serialized and SQL data you need twice as much.
		Thus, avoid activating Dilithium on configurations that have massive data sizes (e.g. lots of media items) unless you have the memory to spare.
		Because SQL caching does not download blob data, it is less RAM intensive than serialized item caching for media.
	
	* Dilithium requires a MS SQL database.
	
	* Dilithium depends on the Descendants table in the Sitecore database. If the FastQueryDescendantsDisabled setting is enabled,
			Dilithium will fail to work. If you need to enable this setting, disable Dilithium.
			
	* Do not run multiple sync or reserialize operations at the same time using Dilithium.
	
	* Dilithium does not guarantee identical child ordering to Sitecore. This means that when reserializing a configuration
			that previously did not use Dilithium after activating Dilithium you may find items that are in loopback folders change,
			as different children may be selected to place in loopback. This is normal and no actual data has changed; the items
			are also sync-compatible both with and without Dilithium so you can turn it off without fear if you wish.
